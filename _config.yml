about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I graduated from Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, **University of Zagreb** in 2021. Primary focus of my education was control systems design and robotics in general.
  For my Master's thesis I implemented path generation for UAVs that are visually inspecting buildings.

  In 2021. after my graduation, I started working at Croatian based startup **Gideon Brothers**. My primary focus there was **navigation**, more precisely path following algorithms. But I had a chance to work on a lot of different aspects of robotics, I worked on control system for steering on double ackermann drive, path generation, detection of moving obstacles, communication between robots and coordination of multiple robots with time optimization.
  

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          Project was developed for my Master's thesis. It was consisted of 2 parts: path generation algorithm and desktop app for parameter input and path visualization.
          App gathered building data from online database, connected to Google maps to visualize that building and draw a generated path on it so operator can easily inspect the generated path in 2D space.

          This was my personal project. I wanted to test some of my machine learning algorithms on real market data, unfortunately I did not find any simulator on which I could run Python code.
          So as a personal project and opportunity to learn different frameworks like pandas library or Qt, I started working on my own timeseries simulator.

          My primary job was designing and developing **path following algorithm**, it sends velocity references to robot in order to follow given path. I was in charge of creating and implementing code architecture for that part of the stack. During my time at the company I also had a chance to work on many other fields and gain experience in different parts of stack, from low level control system to high level multirobot operations.

          Some of the projects I was involved in are
            * designing PID regulator for robot turning
            * develop detection and tracking of moving obstacles based on recent papers using 2D lidars
            * develop communication system between multiple robots
            * develop multirobot coordination algorithm with time optimizations.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
